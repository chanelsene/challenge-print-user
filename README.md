# Print User Challenge

Welcome to the Print User Challenge repo. This meets the requirements of the challenge by reading from the files `companies.json` and `users.json` and providing a list of active users whose tokens have been topped up, groupeb by companies, then email status, and ordered by last name. After running the script, the output file can be found in the `/lib` folder. Tests are also available to run.

## Installation
1. You will need to install dependencies with the gem `bundler`. If you do have it already, then skip this step, otherwise run the following command.

`gem install bundler`

2. Then run the below command to install dependencies.

`bundle install`

3. Simply run `rake` for the challenge script to run. You will find the output file in the `/lib` folder.

4. You can also run tests. Simply run `rake test` and observe the results of the tests in the console.
